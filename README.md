# How to use NFV Quality of Service for your PhD thesis?

## Introduction

Here, I want to summarize my experiences and reading list that I use to find a problem and provide an abstraction about the way to solve it as a Ph.D. Thesis.
In the first place I have started with some concepts as follow:

- Determininstic Networking
- NFV
- Optimization
- Reinforcement Learning

Then I choose to solve an optimization problem with reinforcement learning for considering the URLL funcions in NFV.
At 23 Jan 2021 I had a meeting as an qualification exam for presenting my problem and its roadmap.

## Verbal Qualification Exam

These points are discuss in the meeting:

- Problem definition must be S.M.A.R.T
- Consider more theoritical concepts in your research subject
- Access layer delay is important because you are mentioning the end-to-end delay
- Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Services concepts are useful
- Pakcet replication and reliability
- Cite https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8458130
- Determininstic as an adjective is okay?
- Network slicing literature

The total grade of this meeting and the paper examn is 17.25.
