# How to use NFV Quality of Service for your PhD thesis?

## Introduction

Here, I want to summarize my experiences and reading list that I use to find a problem and provide an abstraction about the way to solve it as a Ph.D. Thesis.
In the first place I have started with some concepts as follow:

- Determininstic Networking
- NFV
- Optimization
- Reinforcement Learning

Then I choose to solve an optimization problem with reinforcement learning for considering the ULL funcions in NFV.
At 23 Jan 2021 I have a meeting as an qualification exam for presenting my problem.
